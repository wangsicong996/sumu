# One-command build pipeline for the daily-use frozen player (PyInstaller onedir bundle):
#   native build -> patch third-party deps -> pyinstaller freeze -> stage weights -> smoke test.
# Usage:
#   powershell -File scripts/build_dist.ps1 [-WeightsSrc <dir>] [-SkipNative] [-SkipSmoke] [-FastFreeze]
# -FastFreeze: skip PyInstaller's COLLECT stage (which unconditionally wipes and
#   re-copies the whole ~9-10GB dist\sumu\_internal tree every run -- see the
#   comment in packaging/sumu.spec). Only rebuilds dist\sumu\sumu.exe (sumu's own
#   Python source) plus the native pyd/ffmpeg DLLs, and hand-copies just those
#   over an EXISTING dist\sumu tree. Requires a prior full build (dist\sumu\_internal
#   must already exist) and is only correct when the dependency set itself hasn't
#   changed (no new/updated torch/cv2/tensorrt/mmengine binaries or data files) --
#   i.e. when only sumu's own source or native extension changed.
# Weights source resolution (anyone building this, not just the original dev machine):
#   1. -WeightsSrc if passed explicitly
#   2. $env:SUMU_WEIGHTS_SRC if set (setx SUMU_WEIGHTS_SRC "C:\path\to\model_weights" once, persists
#      across sessions) -- lets each machine/teammate configure this without editing the script or
#      remembering a flag every run.
#   3. $env:LADA_MODEL_WEIGHTS_DIR (legacy compat, same semantics as SUMU_WEIGHTS_SRC)
# If none of the above resolves, the script fails with a clear message -- sumu is self-contained
# and does not assume any external repo layout.
