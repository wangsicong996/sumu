# ── TensorRT acceleration for BasicVSR++ (optional) ────────────────────────────
# When enabled (and device is cuda + fp16), the BasicVSR++ restorer runs as 6
# precompiled TensorRT sub-engines instead of the PyTorch model — ~3x restorer
# throughput. Engines are bound to the GPU architecture / precision / clip-size
# upper bound and are compiled on first use (a one-time, multi-minute, blocking
# step), then cached under model_weights/<stem>_sub_engines/. Non-Nvidia / fp32
# users never trigger this and keep the PyTorch path unchanged.
#
# Default on for the realtime fork's purpose; set LADA_BASICVSRPP_TRT=0 to force
# the PyTorch path (e.g. to skip the first-run compile, or when debugging).

    model's generator and returns it. The caller (app.py) attaches it via

    progress ("Compiling sub-engine i/6…") flows through report_load_progress() to whatever

    compilation was skipped (e.g. VRAM too low) or the freshly-written engines failed to load
    — the GUI compile worker catches that and surfaces it on the first-screen prompt.
