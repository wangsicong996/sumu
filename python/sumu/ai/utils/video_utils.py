    rows [0,h) = luma, rows [h, h*3//2) = interleaved chroma) to a GPU BGR HWC uint8 tensor,
    matching libswscale's bgr24 output (MAE ~1 on real content -> AI-transparent).

    Ported from lada-realtime's `lada.utils.video_utils._nv12_to_bgr_hwc_gpu`, credited in
    full below, with one deliberate change to the function's *contract* (not its math):

    - lada's original takes a CPU numpy nv12 array and does `torch.from_numpy(nv12).to(
      torch_device, non_blocking=True)` internally, because PyAV cannot hand out the NVDEC
      surface zero-copy and a host round trip is unavoidable there (see lada's own docstring,
      reproduced below).
    - sumu's production input is different: the native `Player.get_cuda_nv12_by_frame()`
      bridge (native/src/player.cpp, validated by spikes/spike3_nv12_interop) already
      delivers a CUDA-resident NV12 buffer -- the whole point of that bridge is I3 (all-GPU,
      never touch main memory). Forcing a CPU numpy array through this function here would
      silently reintroduce the exact host round trip spike 3 eliminated. So this port takes
      `nv12` as an already-CUDA-resident torch.Tensor (uint8, shape (h*3//2, w)) and drops the
      `torch_device`/`torch.from_numpy(...).to(device)` upload step entirely -- everything
      else (the fp16 nearest-chroma-upsample BT.601/BT.709 + limited/full-range math) is
      unchanged from lada's original.

    This is the same math spike 3's local `spike3_driver.py` adaptation used (see
    docs/spike3_nv12_interop.md), now promoted into the shared production module instead of
    living as a spike-local copy. Validated there: MAE vs. independent PyAV CPU bgr24
    reference = 0.6994 (1080p) / 0.6215 (4K), both within lada's own "~1, AI-transparent"
    expectation for this formula.

    Caller-side pitfall this spike found and fixed (not a bug in this function itself, but a
    correction the *caller* must apply when deriving `full_range` from FFmpeg's
    `AVColorRange`): `AVCOL_RANGE_MPEG == 1` (limited/"tv"), `AVCOL_RANGE_JPEG == 2`
    (full/"pc") -- i.e. `full_range = (color_range == 2)`. lada's own source comments have
    this backwards; getting it wrong doesn't crash, it silently produces a plausible-but-wrong
    image with elevated MAE (~6-8 instead of ~0.6-0.7). See docs/spike3_nv12_interop.md
    "Second bug found" for the full writeup.

    Original lada docstring (kept for context): "Convert a CPU nv12 frame (shape (h*3//2, w)
    uint8, as PyAV's to_ndarray('nv12') returns for an NVDEC-decoded frame) to a GPU BGR HWC
    uint8 tensor, matching libswscale's bgr24 output (MAE ~1 on this content ->
    AI-transparent; the models were trained on swscale frames). [...] Chroma is
    nearest-upsampled (repeat_interleave); BT.601 (the swscale default for unspecified
    colourspace, which is what these files declare) vs BT.709 and limited/full range are

    Flagging this discrepancy explicitly rather than silently working around it (matching the
    project's established honesty precedent in docs/spike3_nv12_interop.md's own "Discrepancy
    found in the task's premise" section): lada's original is NOT actually a pure function --
    it constructs a `VideoReader` (`with VideoReader(video_file, device=device,
    prefer_fast_seek=prefer_fast_seek) as vr: ... vr.seek(start_ns) ...`) on its PyAV-probe
    fallback path, to work around PyAV's BACKWARD seek landing on the nearest keyframe
    at-or-before the requested point rather than the requested point itself. Porting that
    branch verbatim would require porting `VideoReader`, which this task explicitly excludes
    (production decode does not go through PyAV/pynvc).

    sumu doesn't need that probe at all: native `Player.seek(frame_num)` (native/src/player.cpp)
    already anchors to the real decoded PTS internally (I5) and returns the true landed frame
    number directly from `Decoder::seek_to_frame`'s own PTS-based search -- see
    docs/native_core.md's "seek() = reposition" section, and the 4a regression's seek-stress
    result (20/20 `actual == target`, i.e. frame-exact against the *requested* frame in that
    test content's GOP structure). So the "probe-decode to discover where a backward-keyframe
    seek actually landed" problem lada's version solves does not exist in sumu's architecture
    -- callers should use `Player.seek()`'s own return value as the ground truth, not this
    function.

    What's kept from lada here is only the trivially pure fast-path math (lada's own
    `_pynvc_backend_available` branch: pynvc/frame-accurate seeks land exactly on
    `offset_ns_to_frame_num(start_ns, video_fps_exact)`, no probe needed) -- useful as a
    quick estimate (e.g. for pre-seek UI/logging) when no live `Player` handle is available
    yet to ask directly. This is an intentional simplification, not an oversight: do not treat
    this function's return value as authoritative for anything that needs true frame-accuracy
    against sumu's own decode; use `Player.seek()`'s return value for that.
