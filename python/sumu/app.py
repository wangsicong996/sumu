# Daily-use player entrypoint -- unlike scripts/run_player.py (verification scaffolding: fixed
# --seconds auto-exit, --seek-test, --correctness, trace dump), this has no timeout, no forced
# seek, no trace dump. Closing the window (X/ESC) no longer quits directly: with native
# park_on_close enabled it close-parks the player (window hidden, warm models kept resident)
# for _PARK_SECONDS, and a relaunch inside that window is forwarded back to THIS process over
# the single-instance pipe (single_instance.py) for a zero-warmup reopen. The park deadline
# passing with no relaunch -- or Ctrl-C -- is what actually exits (finally -> player.close()).
#
# Frozen-safe: no sys.path hacks here -- the caller (dev shim scripts/play.py, or a future
# PyInstaller spec/entry point) is responsible for making `sumu` and `sumu_core` importable
# before calling main().
#
# Startup-UX (model-warmup-in-background): unlike the old version of this module, main() no
# longer blocks the main thread on model warmup (torch import + build_models()) before
# showing anything. The window appears immediately
# and stays responsive (pump_messages() every tick) while warmup runs on a background daemon
# thread; an open/drop-file prompt is shown until the user picks a file, and a small
# "正在预热模型…" status float (native build_status_float(), driven by set_status_text()) tracks
# warmup progress. Opening a file no longer waits on the models -- player.open() plus play()
# starts original-passthrough playback immediately (present's AI-absent fallback, see
# DESIGN.md I9); the Scheduler is only constructed once warmup finishes, at which point AI
# frames start covering the passthrough ones with no playback interruption.
