# Clock-driven AI producer that fills the native Player's ready-map ahead of the present
# head. This is the integration piece connecting the already-validated native core
# (native/src/player.cpp, contracts in docs/native_core.md / docs/native_ai_input.md) to the
# already-ported AI compute core (python/sumu/ai/, contracts exercised end-to-end in
# scripts/verify_scene_clip_blend.py).
#
# Architectural semantics this module must uphold (DESIGN.md):
#   I1 - present never blocks on AI. This module runs on its own daemon thread and every
#        native call it makes (get_cuda_nv12_by_frame / push_ai_frame) is designed by the
#        native layer itself to be non-blocking for the present thread; this module never
#        calls anything that could stall present.
#   I2 - present/AI are decoupled. Scheduler only talks to Player through its public,
#        already-validated API; it never touches present-loop internals.
#   I5 - frame number is the single source of truth. Every dict/list here is keyed by the
#        frame_num Player itself hands out (get_cuda_nv12_by_frame's echoed frame_num,
#        Player.current_frame(), Player.seek()'s returned actual frame).
#   I6 - seek = reposition. On a seek, this module resets its own in-flight AI state
#        (scenes/frame_cache/frontier) to the new position; it never tears down or recreates
#        threads/models.
#   I9 - degrade, never stall. If AI falls behind, the frontier is resynced to the present
#        head (dropping in-flight work) instead of trying to catch up frame-by-frame; if a
#        frame isn't decoded yet, the loop just sleeps and retries. Present always has a
#        clean passthrough fallback (native side), so under any of these conditions the only
#        visible effect is a lower ai_hit_rate, never a stutter.
#
# This is a *rewrite* of lada-realtime's worker/PipelineQueue orchestration (single daemon
# thread here, no queues, no STOP_MARKER/EOF_MARKER handshake - see DESIGN.md D "重写"), but
# it calls the *ported* pure functions verbatim (scene_clip.py / blend.py / video_utils.py /
# cuda_dlpack.py) exactly as scripts/verify_scene_clip_blend.py already exercised them.
